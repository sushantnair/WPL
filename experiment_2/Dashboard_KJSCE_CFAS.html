                   Hello dear user
                   This page requires the back-end of the website to be functional
                
                   If you are logged in and are a student, then you will be able to see the courses you are studying,
                   whether or not you have yet filled all the course feedback forms you are supposed to fill, and an 
                   analysis of your responses for each course.
                   <a href = "AM-I_Feedback_KJSCE_CFAS.html">Click here</a> to give your feedback about the 
                   course Applied Mathematics - I.
                
                
                   If you are logged in and are a faculty member, then you will be able to see the courses you are 
                   teaching, and if you have not yet created a course feedback form for a course that you are teaching,
                   then you will see an option to create a form for that course. Further, you will see all the responses
                   from all the students and an analysis of the responses in the form of a pie chart, which will give you
                   an idea as to the strengths and weaknesses of the course and methods of improvement.
